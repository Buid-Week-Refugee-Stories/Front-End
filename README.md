Title: Solomon Awan

Text: "My name is Solomon Awan. I was born in Sudan before South Sudan became an independent State. After the independence, I fall under the new state of South Sudan.
I love South Sudan. Live was peaceful until the Sudan’s civil war began in the 80s.
Due to the civil war, I left Sudan in 1987 for refugee camp in Ethiopia then to Kenya. I lived in those two camps for the total of 13 years, 4 years in Ethiopia and 9 in Kenya.
It was after refugee camp in Kenya when I was given an opportunity to come to the United States in 2001.
Integration to the new culture here in the US was not easy, but it turns out well. I was able to make new friends that helped me navigate the system. Through the help of my new American friends, I was able to go to college and successfully graduate.
Now I am happily married and have a career I am proud of." Read more at https://www.kued.org/finding-home/solomon-awan

Location: Myanmar (Burma), Southeast Asia & Utah

Title: Poe Wah

Text: "I was born in Burma and fled to Thailand back in 1985 due to persecution, torture and evacuation by the Burmese soldiers. My village was burned down and villagers were shot or forced to be their porters. Therefore, I had to flee and seek for refuge on the Thailand border line.
I was a refugee in Thai refugee camp and have no citizenship and no freedom because the camp was fenced with the iron blade steel rope and no refugee is allowed to get out of the camp by the Thai authority. We had limited food ration and water in the camp. No further education after 12 grades and no income to support the family except those who are hired at the NGOs agencies. For all that reasons, I decided to apply for resettlement to United States.
My experience here in Salt Lake City when I first arrived was pretty much common with other refugees. I had problem with the local food, public transportation system, snow and more. Language is the hardest part.
I came to Salt Lake City, Utah, straight from Thailand and go nowhere until presently. In term of success, myself, I am physically incapacitated but now receiving social security benefit and my wife has a job bringing home income. My wife and myself are now gaining the language that we are able to communicate with people and my kids are doing perfect with the language. I also have my own car now and able to assist other new arrival refugees.
I want to see myself gain more language skill that I am able to read and write well. I also wants to see my kids graduate from school. My all-time dream is own a house and I am sure that will happen soon. " Read more at https://www.kued.org/finding-home/poe-wah

Location: Bhutan, South Central Asia & Utah

Title: Gyanu Dulal

Text: “	"My name is Gyanu Dulal and I am a refugee from Bhutan.
	Bhutan is a small Himalayan Kingdom between China and India. It is ruled by the people of the Tibetan Origin. Nepalese were taken to Bhutan with an agreement between the King of Nepal and Bhutan to cultivate the fertile agricultural land in the southern part of the country in the early 17th. Century and at different period of times many Nepalese families migrated to Bhutan since they were welcomed by the government and granted land ownership and the citizenship in 1958. In the early 80s, the government brought many changes in the country and adapted the policy of One Nation One People and Nepalese were deprived of the basic rights to practice their religion, cultural, speech, and language. Nepalese demanded for human rights, equality, and democracy but the government turned down the demand and called them terrorist and gave the ultimatum to leave the country or face the consequences of the punishment or death. The Bhutan Army and police forces started arresting, detaining and torturing, raping girls and women and looting the families.
	Like many families of the village, I left the country with my parents and reached Nepal where the camps have been started to be pitched on the bank of the river. Hundreds of trucks unloaded the people on the river bank every day and there was not management to help these people with food water and shelter. We had to beg in the surrounding village to survive and sleep under the open sky. Hundreds of children and people of all ages died every day. After several months national and international agencies got involved and camps were set up. I spent 18 years of my life in the refugee camp, in scarcity fighting for life every day.
I came to Utah in May 2008 with my wife and two children. International Rescue Committee resettled me and my family and helped with the initial assistance. It was very difficult in the beginning to start a new life in the new world with everything so new and different. But the little broken English I have helped me to communicate with the caseworker and other staffs of the agency and ask for assistance. 
My plan in the future is to open a family trust or a nonprofit and help the poor and needy people in Nepal or elsewhere in the field of Education and Health. All my siblings who are here in Utah and my children have the same thought and I am sure I will be able to achieve this great mission of me and my family."

Location: Democratic Republic of Congo & Utah

Title: Godeliva Mukangatare

Text: "I was born in Rutshuru, Congo. My country was very good but I had to leave because of the war between tribes. I am Tutsi and I left because the Hutu were persecuting us.
I was a refugee in Rwanda since 1996 in the camp Gihembe, Bwimba. I was resettled in Utah on 12-11-2013. I was happy to get help from the government and have friends. However, I went through domestic violence in my first months of arrival and went to live in the shelter. Women have rights and freedom here. Back home in Africa women are like an object.
But I was surprised in America you do not talk to your neighbor and not know their name. In Congo we live as family and you greet everyone you meet. I learned how to ride the public transportation and now I can speak a little English.
My goals are to have my citizenship and driver’s license. I also hope to get my high school diploma and go to college. I will be helping Congolese women in Utah." Read more at https://www.kued.org/finding-home/godeliva-mukangatare

Location: Burundi, Central Africa & Utah

Title: Beatrice Bulikukiye

Text: 	"I was born in Burundi. I remember that I was a happy child, with loving parents before the war started. This is all of what I can remember about my childhood. I can’t tell much about how I left my country. I can only remember walking long miles from my house in middle of the night. My parents kept quieting me all the way. I didn’t know why we had to leave everything we ever had. Our cows, goats, house, clothes….
	I grew up in a refugee camp in Rwanda. I didn’t have a chance to go to school and didn’t know my birthday. In Rwanda I was hoping to meet some of my friends who I grew up with. I got new friends but nothing was ever the same.
	In Rwanda, Life wasn’t easy. Sometimes, we didn’t have enough to eat. And there, the war started again. We had to leave the country, walking miles and miles. We landed in Tanzania. In our new country, we hoped that things would be different. But refugee camp is refugee camp. You don’t have what you want when you want. We had many challenges every day. I had 3 children. Unfortunately my husband was not a good father to help me to raise my children. I had to find a way to provide for us. When I heard from the resettlement agency that I am coming in America, it was a dream comes true. I thank God all my life. In America, I know that I am in good hands. My children and I have everything we need. I just say a big 'Thank You' to America for everything.
	God Bless America." Read more at https://www.kued.org/finding-home/beatrice-bulikukiye

Title: Atem Thuch Aleu

Text: "When I stepped off the plane in the Salt Lake airport early on March 7, 2001, I knew that I had entered a different world. The first time I came to Utah, I saw a lot of new things that I had not seen before. It was very difficult for me to learn all of these new things. I was faced with a new challenge; adjusting to a completely new way of life.
In Africa we had seen cars but had never used them. We had to walk to buy our food. We had to walk to school as well. When I came to the States I had to learn how to drive and how to catch a bus. I also had to learn how to work, because I had never had a job before.
I am Sudanese by birth and nationality. I am one of the refugees who arrived to Utah. I want to show my new neighbors in Utah what life was like in Africa. I want them to know about my culture. I also want to tell them about the civil war in my country, and how it changed my life and those of my people.” Read more at https://www.kued.org/finding-home/atem-thuch-aleu

Location: Democratic Republic of Congo & Utah

Title: Antoinette Uwanyiguira

Text: "I was born in the providence of North Kivu in Congo. My country was peaceful but I left because of political problem and tribal conflicts. I went to a refugee camp in Cameroon for 9 months then came to Utah.
I went through the third country resettlement interview in Cameroon, Garwa and passed the interview. I was resettled to Utah due to the big family I had with 7 children.
When I arrived, I was surprised that nobody greeted each other in the mornings and that you don’t know your neighbor. To learn English was challenging, but the biggest challenge was to raise teenagers in the USA and to deal with the school system. American culture is different from African culture especially with youth and families. People here are not social.
However, since my arrival I have worked hard, I got my high school diploma. I can now read and write in English. I am proud of my daughter who is going to college.
My future goal is to support women to work hard and go to school. The American relocation experience taught me if you work hard you can be someone."
